Step 3 [ Transfer .tflite into STM32CubeMX ]
	3.1
	1) Create a new project of STM32H747I-DISCO
	2) "Software Packs" -> "Select Components"
	3) Show conponents for content -> "Cortex-M7"
	4) active the "Core" of X-CUBE-AI
	5) set Application as "Application", and click "OK"
	6) click "Software Packs", allow CubeMX open peripherals automatically
	7) Add network, name it "network", select "TFLite" as file type, and select your .tflite file, click "Analyze"
	8) after analyzing finished, click "OK
	9) click gear button to do advance setting, check the box of "Use activation buffer for input buffer"
	10) make sure the box of "Use activation buffer for output buffer" is unselected, then click "OK"
	11) it'll auto analyze again, after it finished, click "Validate on desktop" to check out the model work functionally
	12) go to "Project Manager"
	13) give the project name and location, choose "STM32CubeIDE" as Toolchain
	14) click "GENERATE CODE"
 
	3.2
	1) double click ".project" file in "FP-AI-VISION1_V3.1.0\Projects\STM32H747I-DISCO\Applications\PersonDetection\MobileNetv2_Model\STM32CubeIDE" to generate project
	2) replace the model file ( network.c, network.h, network_config.h, network_data.h, network_data_params.c, network_data_params.h) by the files generate in Step 3(file of CubeMX is locate at  "CM7\X-CUBE-AI\App")  P.S. .h files locate at Inc and .c files are in Src
	3) open CM7\Application\fp_vision_app.c
	4) go to line 125, chage the labels as the output labels of your model
	5) right click on the CM7 project, choose Clean Project
	6) debug and run it on the broad
